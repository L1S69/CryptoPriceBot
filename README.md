## Translations

To make a custom translation for your Telegram bot, follow these steps:

1. Locate the `translations/` directory in your project.
2. Copy any existing JSON file in the `translations/` directory. The JSON file represents the language translation for your bot.
3. Rename the copied file to the desired language code. For example, if you want to create a translation for French, you can name it `fr.json`.
4. Open the copied JSON file with a text editor.
5. Translate the phrases and messages in the file to the desired language.
6. Save the file with the translated phrases.
7. Open the `config.py` file in your project.
8. Locate the `supported_languages` dictionary in the `config.py` file.
9. Add an entry for your newly created language code and specify the language name as the key. For example, if you added a translation for French, you can add `"ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·French": "fr"` to the `supported_languages` dictionary.
10. Save the `config.py` file.

Once you have completed these steps, your bot will be able to use the custom translation for the specified language. You can now set the newly added language as the default language for your bot or allow users to select it using the available language selection functionality.
